Wish to create a WebGl + three.js game similar to KixEye Vega Conflict.. Only a mess around project as a learning exercise.
Welcome anybodies help on this project... 

if anyone chooses to help work on this project, please document what your changes or additions do,
all comments whether it be in htlm, js, css or any other file must be prepended by ::>>.

Will set up a Kik messenger group/skype & deviant art group in the near future for all contributors to be able to communicate,
& bounce ideas of one another.                                              

12.12.19 ::>> Going to Change from Three.js to Babylon.js just for the sheer ammount of features that it includes,
              Such as built in physics, game engine & post processing features.
