# OpenSourceSpaceGame
Wish to create a WebGl + three.js game similar to KixEye Vega Conflict which is on google play, this is probably on of my favourite Android games & would be fun to try and replicate or rebuild a custom version.. Only a mess around project as a learning exercise.
Welcome anybodies help on this project... 

if anyone chooses to help work on this project, please document what your changes or additions do,
all comments whether it be in htlm, js, css or any other file must be prepended by ::>>. This is to help with the learning & so others can see what has been done.

Will set up a Kik messenger group/skype & deviant art group in the near future for all contributors to be able to communicate,
& bounce ideas of one another.

Will create some guidelines and to-do lists shortly.

Not sure whether this will include React.js yet, but it will definately use the Physics Library
or some of its components for Collision detection & projectiles. May also include Three.js or Parralax.

Update Soon.
