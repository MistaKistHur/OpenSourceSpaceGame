Wish to create the majority of the assets myself or ourselves,
  But these are useful for reference and Ideas.
  Things like heightmaps & textures don't generally need
  to be created, if you can get them for free. Unless there for a specific purpose.
  This list will be updated as and when I find new outlets.

  To view the assets we have already to work with,
  please view the image folders, inside of the Assets Folder.
